-- The dataset for this exercise has been derived from the `Indeed Data Scientist/Analyst/Engineer` [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/indeed-dataset-data-scientistanalystengineer) on kaggle.com. 

-- Before beginning to answer questions, take some time to review the data dictionary and familiarize yourself with the data that is contained in each column.

-- #### Provide the SQL queries and answers for the following questions/tasks using the data_analyst_jobs table you have created in PostgreSQL:

-- 1.	How many rows are in the data_analyst_jobs table?

-- SELECT 
-- COUNT(*)
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs;

-- 2.	Write a query to look at just the first 10 rows. What company 
-- is associated with the job posting on the 10th row?

-- SELECT
-- company
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- LIMIT 10;

--ExxonMobil

-- 3.	How many postings are in Tennessee? How many are there in either
-- Tennessee or Kentucky?

-- SELECT 
-- count(location) AS postings_In_Tennessee
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE location = 'TN';

-- 21 in TN

-- SELECT 
-- count(location) AS postings_In_Tennessee_or_Kentucky 
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE location = 'TN' OR location = 'KY';

--27 in the TN or KY

-- 4.	How many postings in Tennessee have a star rating above 4?
-- SELECT 
-- COUNT (star_rating) AS five_star_posting
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE star_rating >=5 AND location = 'TN'

--1 

-- 5.	How many postings in the dataset have a review count between 500 and 1000?
-- SELECT
-- 	COUNT (review_count) AS tween_one_n_half_k
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE review_count 
-- 	BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;

-- 151

-- 6.	Show the average star rating for companies in each state. 
-- The output should show the state as `state` and the average rating
-- 	for the state as `avg_rating`. Which state shows the highest average rating?

-- SELECT 
-- 	avg(star_rating) as avg_rating,
-- 	company as company,
-- 	location as state
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE star_rating IS NOT NULL
-- group by company, location, star_rating
-- order by star_rating desc;

-- There is a tie between the top twelve companies 
-- "Globoforce Limited"
-- "ClearView Healthcare Partners"
-- "Alteryx, Inc."
-- "Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy"
-- "Doximity"
-- "GoodRx"
-- "Bowery Farming"
-- "Vista Technology Services"
-- "Acquisition Life Cycle Management"
-- "Beaver Dam Community Hospitals, Inc."
-- "Ramsey Solutions"
-- "Blade"

-- 7.	Select unique job titles from the data_analyst_jobs table. How many are there?

-- SELECT 
-- count(DISTINCT(title))
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs;

-- 881

-- 8.	How many unique job titles are there for California companies?
-- SELECT 
-- count(DISTINCT(title))
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE location = 'CA';

-- 230

 -- 9.	Find the name of each company and its average star rating for all 
-- companies that have more than 5000 reviews across all locations. How many 
-- 	companies are there with more that 5000 reviews across all locations?

-- SELECT 
-- 	avg(star_rating) as avg_rating,
-- 	company as company,
-- 	location as state,
-- 	review_count as reviews
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE review_count > 5000
-- group by company, location, review_count;

-- 83

-- 10.	Add the code to order the query in #9 from highest to lowest 
-- average star rating. Which company with more than 5000 reviews across
-- 	all locations in the dataset has the highest star rating? What is that rating?

-- SELECT 
-- 	avg(star_rating) as avg_rating,
-- 	company,
-- 	location as state,
-- 	review_count as reviews
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE review_count > 5000
-- GROUP by company, location, review_count
-- ORDER BY avg_rating desc;
--Looks like theres a tie between the top 9 companies

-- 11.	Find all the job titles that contain the word ‘Analyst’. 
-- How many different job titles are there? 

-- SELECT 
-- COUNT(DISTINCT title)
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE title LIKE '%analyst%' or title like '%Analyst%'; 

-- 757

-- 12.	How many different job titles do not contain either the word ‘Analyst’ or
-- the word ‘Analytics’? What word do these positions have in common?

-- SELECT	
-- 	COUNT(DISTINCT title)
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- WHERE title NOT LIKE 'Analyst' AND title NOT LIKE 'Analytics';

-- 881
--"ANALY"

-- **BONUS:**
-- You want to understand which jobs requiring SQL are hard to fill.
-- Find the number of jobs by industry (domain) that require SQL and
-- have been posted longer than 3 weeks. 
--  - Disregard any postings where the domain is NULL. 
--  - Order your results so that the domain with the greatest number 
-- of `hard to fill` jobs is at the top. 
--  - Which three industries are in the top 3 on this list? How many
-- jobs have been listed for more than 3 weeks for each of the top 3?

-- SELECT 
-- 	count(title) AS number_of_hard_to_fill_jobs,
-- 	domain AS field,
-- 	skill
-- FROM data_analyst_jobs
-- where 
-- 	days_since_posting > 21
-- 	AND SKILL LIKE '%SQL%'
-- 	AND domain IS NOT NULL
-- GROUP BY domain, days_since_posting, skill
-- ORDER BY number_of_hard_to_fill_jobs DESC 
-- LIMIT 3;
